## Key Guidelines
1. Follow best practices and idiomatic patterns.
2. Maintain existing code structure and organization.
3. Do NOT over-complicate simple code, if it is working.
4. I am a minimal kinda guy, I dislike fancy over-compicated code when un-needed.
5. I like my settings, colors, names, etc.. don't change them for no reason, if you have to explain. (It's better isn't a valid excuse).
